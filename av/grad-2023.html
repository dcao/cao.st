        <h2 class="text-xl mt-8 mb-3 font-semibold text-slate-400">pricing</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">With pricing, my goal is to strike a balance between what's reasonable between your means (we're all broke college students here) and what's reasonable as compensation for my own labor.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">My philosophy for payment is <strong>base rate, plus pay what you want</strong>. I charge a base rate depending on if you're taking pics on your own or as a group, and if you have the means, you can pay however much extra depending on what you think the service is worth. My base rates are below:</p>

        <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 mb-8">
            <div class="border border-slate-600 px-2 py-3">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-slate-300 mb-2">Individual</h2>
                <p class="text-slate-400 mb-4">
                    However many locations, outfits you can fit in <span class="text-slate-300">2 hours</span>
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-300 text-lg">$75</p>
            </div>
            <div class="border border-slate-600 px-2 py-3">
                <h2 class="text-lg font-bold text-slate-300 mb-2">Group</h2>
                <p class="text-slate-400 mb-4">
                    However many locations, outfits you can fit in <span class="text-slate-300">2 hours</span>
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-300 text-lg">$65/person (2-5 people)</p>
                <p class="text-slate-300 text-lg">$60/person (â‰¥6 people)</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p class="mb-2">With that being said, I'm also relatively flexible with these rates; I know that depending on background, having grad photos can be a luxury that may seem monetarily out of reach, so if you do need any sort of accommodation here, please let me know and I'm more than happy to work something out!</p>

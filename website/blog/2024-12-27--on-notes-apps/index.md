</aside>

My early 20s have been a lot.<sup><em>[citation needed]</em></sup>
Adjusting to moving back to the Bay, building a support network and
finding my folks here, navigating maintaining long-distance friendships,
figuring out questions around my identity and all of its
dimensions---cultural, work, and otherwise... it's a lot to navigate,
and it can feel very overwhelming at times.

On top of that, this late-stage capitalism shit sucks ass, and
finding space for joy and leisure while bearing (witness to) the
mundane, everyday violences of white supremacy, capitalism, and
colonialism is a lot. Existing is fucking *hard*.

In these trying times, my silly little notes apps are how I keep myself
sane. If I have a bunch of big overwhelming projects I need to work
on, breaking them down into small, manageable, actionable tasks helps
keep me grounded. If I have a bunch of thoughts and feelings swimming
around in my head, writing them down somewhere gives me peace of mind
knowing that there's somewhere I can reference them and I don't have to
spend more brain energy keeping it in my own head.

I like to imagine my notes system like *a box*. Without a notes system,
my obligations and thoughts feel infinite and overwhelming. But if I can
put them all into a box, if I know exactly what I need to do and when I
need to do it, everything feels more in control. I have a finite list of
things to do I can point to, and there's nothing outside the box to do.
I got this. *Everything will be okay.*

I care a lot about knowledge management systems: notes apps, todo lists,
and everything in between. And I'm gonna spend the rest of this article
talking about my thoughts and opinions about them.

# Caveats

Before we keep moving, I have some caveats I want to touch on first.

## It's not you, it's me

Notes apps are deeply personal things. Folks are putting their deepest
and darkest secrets in the Apple Notes app as we speak. The systems
folks use to take notes, to keep track of things to do---these are a
reification of how they see the world!

All of my thoughts below---including how I deal with and conceptualize
my anxiety and stress---is just for me. Maybe none of this works for
you, and that's okay! However you conceptualize and manage stress and
anxiety and overwhelming stuff in your own life, whatever works for you
is totally valid! If you think the way I talk about "the box" is dumb
and doesn't match what you think of it---that's cool! Everyone's brain
works a lil differently, and the way that works for you is the way that
works for you.

If there's one takeaway I want you to have from this article, it's this:
everyone's brain is different, and people's knowledge management should
fit their brains. Find a system that works for you and your brain in a
particular context! And don't be afraid to adapt it to your current
vibes. No notes app will fit your brain perfectly---you'll have to play
around and see which apps are amenable to being molded to work with your
brain!

## This is not an endorsement of capitalism

One of the ✨silly and goofy✨ aspects of our capitalist hell is that it
sells you band-aid solutions that superficially address (but actually
worsen) the systemic violences it enacts. Feeling a deep sense of ennui
and alienation from your labor? Here's a meditation app you can
subscribe to! <span class="aside"> See <a

the Radical Politics of Self-Care: A Crip-of-Color Critique"</a> by Jina
Kim and Sami Schalk for more on that last point. </span>

And so it goes with notes apps. 

These days, numerous companies and startups have popped out of the
woodwork, looking to sell you Free Time As A Service. These tools all
speak a particular kind of language, looking to ["optimize" your
schedule](https://reclaim.ai/) or
"[maximize](https://www.notion.com/use-case/time-management)
[productivity](https://www.usemotion.com/)."

<aside>
<p>
Obviously, this is not the case with <em>every</em> digital
organizational tool. However, this kind of framing and marketing does
tend to be particularly common with (1) tools marketed for business use,
and/or (2) tools backed by VC funding. Go figure!
</p>

<p>
There are certainly diversions from this kind of rhetoric.
For example, the use of the term <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">"digital garden"</a>
to refer to personal wikis and knowledge bases is interesting. What
epistemic work is done when we analogize collecting knowledge to tending
to a garden&mdash;a personal practice and art that can be enjoyed for its
own sake? What does this <em>do</em>?
</p>

<p>
There are also exceptions to the "notes apps are services that lock away
your data for mysterious AI bullshit" rule;
<a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> is the most obvious example, which we'll
get to soon ;)
</p>
</aside>

These are tools marketed as
ways to cope with the imperatives of capital, yet they are still
beholden to its syntax and semantics, seeing themselves as valuable only
insofar as they enable you to do more work or make creative output [more
dependable and reproducible](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/), as
if we are all Henry Ford looking to assembly line our brains into order.
I am no longer a person trying to live an introspective, fulfilling, and
restful life. I'm a [*knowledge worker*](https://logseq.com/). We *all*
are, apparently.

These apps are full of the same Silicon Valley bullshit that has become
inescapable in the rest of our lives. All this info is stuck in whatever
bullshit cloud these companies want to lock my data away in, because
heaven forbid my data outlasts the 5 years these companies last before
their VC funding runs out. And why do I want AI turning my notes into
["actionable insights??"](https://www.notion.com/product/ai) What the
*fuck*?

Relatedly, a whole subculture of folks focused on "productivity" has
sprung up around these tools. Influencers show off their perfectly
curated Notions that they use to plan out their content schedule.
Academics and students on TikTok talking about how they use these tools,
proclaiming that this "one simple trick" got them all A's in their
classes.

---

I want to be very clear. I am not interested in valorizing productivity,
and I sure as hell don't want to *optimize* or *maximize* anything.

I don't want my tools to let me do more work. I want my tools to bring
*joy* into my life. These are tools for facilitating doing things I
enjoy and spending time with folks I love, for finding space for joy and
leisure in the midst of the bullshit that is productivity culture and
capitalism.

# My requirements

At a high level, a notes system should exist to get thoughts out of my
head and into somewhere tangible so I can stop thinking about it. Many
of my notes tend to be *fleeting*. My notes go through constant churn,
and I don't like having a huge mass of notes lying around cause it
stressed me out---it feels like brain cruft. For the most part, the
notes I look at on a daily basis---the ones that record most of my todos
and tasks---should have a minimum of cruft, and show what's immediate
and actionable.

- I often have tasks I need to get done, whether for work (class
  assignments, research tasks, prep for meetings) or in my personal life
  (errands I have to run, things I need to do for my hobbies, random
  one-off tasks people ask me to do).
  - It's very easy for me to feel overwhelmed by the amount of work I
    have to do---that there are an infinite amount of things I need to
    do, and an infinite amount of things I need to do *that I don't know
    about*.
  - Keeping track of these tasks and when they need to be finished by
    helps calm my anxiety around all the things I need to do---it helps
    to see that my list of todos is finite, that everything I need to do
    can be listed out in one place, and isn't never-ending or infinite.
  - These big tasks often involve lots of little tasks I need to take
    care of too. If I have a task for "finding a therapist," that might
    involve researching lists of therapists, contacting therapists
    individually and scheduling times to meet, keeping track of who I
    have and haven't replied to for each therapist, and so on. 
  - Being able to break down big tasks into reasonable, bite-sized
    chunks helps make me feel less daunted by the scale of the tasks
    ahead of me.
- Because I'm so scatterbrained, I'm also a chronic sufferer of Oh God I
  Double Booked Myself Syndrome, and I need a way of keeping track of
  all events and commitments.
  - Between blocking out time for spending time with friends, hobbies,
    and work meetings I'm (not) obligated to show up at, if I don't know
    when I'm busy and when I'm not, I just get this constant low-grade
    anxiety about if I'm accidentally scheduling over someone else's
    time, and then I have to go out and resolve it and ... it's just a
    mess :,)
  - I also find that on a day-to-day, I work better when I'm able to do
    detailed timeblocking for myself---allocating specific time for
    working on specific tasks, rather than just having a general todo
    list for "things I need to do at some point at some day." This also
    requires knowing when I'll have time and when I'll be engaged in
    some commitment.
  - So I also need to be able to keep track of calendar events I
    guess...
- And I find notetaking super important too!
  - Sometimes these are notes I take in an academic context, either on a
    class or some other [readings that I happen to be
    doing](https://pl-notes.cao.sh)
  - Sometimes these are short, one-off journals---when a thought appears
    in my head or I'm trying to process some feeling, and I want to
    capture exactly how I'm articulating those feelings to myself in
    that moment.
  - But other times, these journals are much longer.
- And I want to be able to connect all these different parts of my life
  together too!
  - A particular project---say, this website, might be both a personal
    and a research-related endeavor, and should be reachable from both
    those contexts
  - A lot of my journals have to do with (and should be able to
    reference) the other parts of my life that I have notes and todos on
  - Concepts from different academic disciplines may share resonances
    with one another, and I want to be able to explicitly note that!
    - It's giving ✨interdisciplinary✨
  - These concepts might even have resonances with my own personal life
    (this is more common with the humanities side of things).

These requirements imply conflicting designs. I want an *infinite
outliner* to hierarchically structure and organize my notes and tasks,
but I also want *freeform Wikipedia-style linking* to make connections
and identify resonances across notes and tasks. The app needs to be able
to do everything---notes, tasks, and calendar events. And it needs to be
fast and work everywhere, so that I can use it regardless of when or
where I have a thought.

# Joyful tools

Most importantly, it should be a *joy to use the tool itself*. It should
feel *good* to take notes, to list out everything I have to do and check
it off one-by-one. It's hard to want to use the system to get my life
together, unless using the system *is itself* motivating.

Good means a lot of little things. It means the tool should be fast and
responsive. Editing notes should be quick and precise. I shouldn't need
stable WiFi to use it. It should look reasonably pretty, and it should
produce reasonably pretty notes.

The most important part of "good," though, is that if the system doesn't
do something I want it to do, *I can fix it myself.* Keyboard shortcut
isn't doing what I expect it to do? I can add it myself. Do I have a
particular system for archiving old notes I want to use? Let me program
that into the tool. There is nothing as joyful as using a tool that
doesn't demand that I change for the tool, that just does what I expect
it to do, every time.

Because many of the aforementioned tools are hosted by other people, you
*cannot* meaningfully modify or customize them. Sure, you can decorate
your Notion with aesthetic images and a nice colorscheme, and if you're
enough of a Notion wizard, you can do some fun stuff with formulas and
all that. But fundamentally, what you can do in Notion is dictated by
the Notion developers. You have no access to the underlying system, its
code, or your data.

Tools for "productivity" adhere to the rhetorics of capital. Joyful
tools demand that we not only eschew these rhetorics, but imagine
*materially* different systems---systems that are introspectable and
personal.

        This blog post began as a presentation I gave in fall 2022 at
        <a href="https://spaces.ucsd.edu/">SPACES</a>,
        the student-led resource center I worked at while at UCSD.
        This first slide shows a selection of things I was concerned
        with at the time: academics, grad apps, and the then-ongoing UC
        graduate workers strike, to name a few.
    </p>

My early 20s have been a lot.<sup><em>[citation needed]</em></sup>
Moving back to the Bay---where I grew up---has required me to
recontextualize this space grew up in and be very active in not just
reverting back to me as a child growing up here. Building a new support
network here and finding my communities has been its own rewarding (but
sometimes scary) process. Navigating how to maintain my existing
now-long-distance friendships has also been its own challenge. And
figuring out questions about all of my different
identities---connections to my cultural background, the politics and
vibes of my research work---has been a lot too.

These large-scale concerns create a deluge of little things I need to
keep track of in the day-to-day. I have class deadlines on ~~Canvas~~
bCourses I need to keep track of, self-directed research projects that I
need to schedule and pace myself on, meetings I have to block out time
for, errands I have to run, friends both prospective and well-known
whose texts I've left on delivered for days and need to reply to,
important emails I don't even know exist that I need to triage, hobbies
and outside passions I need to make time for, *and* internal thoughts on
all of this that I need to journal and process.

On top of that, late-stage capitalism fucking sucks, and finding space
for joy and leisure while bearing (witness to) the everyday violences of
white supremacy, capitalism, and colonialism is a lot. I gotta do all
this while my tax dollars fund genocide, climate catastrophe marches on
unabated, and while tech companies seem to not give a shit because *the
singularity* or whatever is more important to them.

Needless to say, I get overwhelmed sometimes.

In these trying times, my silly little notes apps are how I keep myself
sane. If I have a bunch of big overwhelming projects I need to work
on, breaking them down into small, manageable, actionable tasks helps
keep me grounded. If I have a bunch of thoughts and feelings swimming
around in my head, writing them down somewhere gives me peace of mind
knowing that there's somewhere I can reference them and I don't have to
spend more brain energy keeping it in my own head.

<aside>
    <img src="notes_apps_2.png" alt="

        Text above reads: 'finiteness keeps me sane.'
    " />
</aside>

I like to imagine my notes system like *a box*. Without a notes system,
my obligations and thoughts feel infinite and overwhelming. But if I can
put them all into a box, if I know exactly what I need to do and when I
need to do it, everything feels more in control. I have a finite list of
things to do I can point to, and there's nothing outside the box to do.
I got this. *Everything will be okay.*

This blog post is a little bit of everything:

- It's a *manifesto* on the personal, political reasons of why I care
  about notes apps so much (and why I think you should care too!);
- It's a *guide* to the various kinds of apps, interventions, and
  systems out there;
- It's a *showcase* of my personal notes system---the philosophy and
  style of how I organize my notes, and the cool things my system lets
  me do.

# CYA

Before we keep moving, I have some caveats I want to touch on first.

## It's not you, it's me

Notes apps are deeply personal things. Folks are putting their deepest
and darkest secrets in the Apple Notes app as we speak. The systems
folks use to take notes, to keep track of things to do---these are a
reification of how they see the world!

All of my thoughts below---including how I deal with and conceptualize
my anxiety and stress---is just for me. Maybe none of this works for
you, and that's okay! However you conceptualize and manage stress and
anxiety and overwhelming stuff in your own life, whatever works for you
is totally valid! Everyone's brain works a lil differently, and the way
that works for you is the way that works for you.

If there's one takeaway I want you to have from this article, it's this:
everyone's brain is different, and people's knowledge management
systems---the *boxes* they use to process the world---should fit their
brains. Find a system that works for you and your brain in a particular
context! And don't be afraid to adapt it to your current vibes. No notes
app will fit your brain perfectly---you'll have to play around and see
which apps are amenable to being molded to work with your brain!

## This is not an endorsement of capitalism

One of the ✨silly and goofy✨ aspects of our capitalist hell is that it
sells you band-aid solutions that superficially address (but actually
worsen) the systemic violences it enacts. Feeling a deep sense of ennui
and alienation from your labor? Here's a meditation app you can
subscribe to!
<span class="aside"> Lots of folks have written on the co-opting of
self-care;
<a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/south-atlantic-quarterly/article-abstract/120/2/325/173307/Reclaiming-the-Radical-Politics-of-Self-CareA-Crip?redirectedFrom=fulltext">"Reclaiming the Radical Politics of Self-Care: A Crip-of-Color Critique"</a>
by Jina
Kim and Sami Schalk is my favorite treatment of this right now.
</span>

And so it goes with notes apps. 

These days, numerous companies and startups have popped out of the
woodwork, looking to sell you Free Time As A Service. These tools all
speak a particular kind of language, looking to ["optimize" your
schedule](https://reclaim.ai/) or
"[maximize](https://www.notion.com/use-case/time-management)
[productivity](https://www.usemotion.com/)."

<aside>
<p>
Obviously, this is not the case with <em>every</em> digital
organizational tool. However, this kind of framing and marketing does
tend to be particularly common with (1) tools marketed for business use,
and/or (2) tools backed by VC funding. Go figure!
</p>

<p>
There are certainly diversions from this kind of rhetoric.
For example, the use of the term <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">"digital garden"</a>
to refer to personal wikis and knowledge bases is interesting. What
epistemic work is done when we analogize collecting knowledge to tending
to a garden&mdash;a personal practice and art that can be enjoyed for its
own sake? What does this <em>do</em>?
</p>

<p>
There are also exceptions to the "notes apps are services that lock away
your data for mysterious AI bullshit" rule;
<a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> is the most obvious example, which we'll
get to soon ;)
</p>
</aside>

These are tools marketed as
ways to cope with the imperatives of capital, yet they are still
beholden to its syntax and semantics, seeing themselves as valuable only
insofar as they enable you to do more work or make creative output [more
dependable and reproducible](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/), as
if we are all Henry Ford looking to assembly line our brains into order.
I am no longer a person trying to live an introspective, fulfilling, and
restful life. I'm a [*knowledge worker*](https://logseq.com/),
apparently.

These apps are full of the same Silicon Valley bullshit that has become
inescapable in the rest of our lives. All this info is stuck in whatever
bullshit cloud these companies want to lock my data away in, because
heaven forbid my data outlasts the 5 years these companies last before
their VC funding runs out. And why do I want AI turning my notes into
["actionable insights??"](https://www.notion.com/product/ai) What the
*fuck*?

Relatedly, a whole subculture of folks focused on "productivity" has
sprung up around these tools. Influencers show off their perfectly
curated Notions that they use to plan out their content schedule.
Academics and students on TikTok talking about how they use these tools,
proclaiming that this "one simple trick" got them all A's in their
classes.

---

I want to be very clear. I am not interested in valorizing productivity,
and I sure as hell don't want to *optimize* or *maximize* anything.

I don't want my tools to let me do more work. I want my tools to bring
*joy* into my life. These are tools for facilitating doing things I
enjoy and spending time with folks I love, for finding space for joy and
leisure in the midst of the bullshit that is productivity culture and
capitalism.

# What works for my brain

A notes system consists of notes that are stored in some place (e.g., an
app on your computer or phone or pieces of paper in a box somewhere) and
have some kind of organizational structure imposed on them.

The goal of my personal notes system is to move thoughts out of my head
and into somewhere tangible so I can stop thinking about it. Time spent
thinking about tasks I might(?) have to do or notes I need to remember
is time spent not being present. The faster I can get things out of my
head and into the system, the better.

My notes system should let me organize all of these thoughts in a
structured way, letting me keep track of what I have to do and all of
the resources I need to do these things. It should be a kind of *second
brain* that can help do some thinking for me.

To satisfy these use cases, I need a notes system that is __fast,
flexible, and fun__.

## Fast

A notes system should be *fast* to both read *and* write information:

- It should be fast to *capture* information into my system. I'm
  scatterbrained and anxious; if a thought comes into my head, I need to
  get it out of my head and into the system ASAP. This includes how long
  it takes to open the system, how long it takes to decide where the
  right place for the information is (and put it there), and even how
  laggy or responsive the system is when I'm writing information down.
  And of course, I need to be able to do this from anywhere, including
  when I only have access to a phone, and including when the UC Berkeley
  WiFi starts acting up again.
- It should be fast to *navigate* the system. The system should let me
  organize my notes in a way that lets me easily find them. The system
  should have affordances that allow me to navigate throughout my notes
  quickly---e.g., keyboard shortcuts and commands for quickly moving
  through a note or set of notes.

A system can't be relied on if it's not fast. If a system introduces
roadblocks to inserting, moving, or locating information, I start
hesitating when using the system. If I hesitate when using the system, I
start doubting whether I want to use the system. Once I start doubting
if I want to use the system, it ceases to be useful; I can't offload my
brain into it anymore.


## Flexible

When I say a notes app should be *flexible*, I mean flexibility in two
different ways.

First, a notes app shouldn't just be a notes app. My tasks often include
notes---for instance, a task to finish a school assignment might include
the drafts of that assignment itself. And calendar events like meetings
are themselves a kind of task---they might have subtasks, I may need to
timeblock meetings relative to other tasks, and they might have
associated notes. Thus, a notes app shouldn't just be a notes app; it
should be a todo list app and a calendar app too.

Second, a notes system should afford multiple ways of structuring
information. My "I need everything to be structured and organized" self
prefers *hierarchical structure and outlining*; it lets me (1) break
down big tasks, projects, and ideas into smaller ones; (2) list tasks
and notes under different larger goals, so I can see my progress towards
them; and (3) find information easier:

```
- Research
  - Goal: expand my academic community
    - Task 1
    - Task 2
    - ...
  - Goal: collaborate with folks on the ground
    - Project A
      - 2024-01-01 • Meeting notes
        - ...
      - Tasks
        - ...
```

<!--
TODO: rewrite this section.
      talk about "ooh im interdisciplinary/have poor work life balance,
      and thus the parts of my life blend together
-->

On the other hand, not all information can be strictly hierarchically
organized, and my "ooh I'm scatterbrained and creative and
✨interdisciplinary✨" brain wants to be able to *link related
information together* outside of any hierarchical ordering. For example,
intersectionality comes up in a lot of different humanities contexts,
and I want to be able to reference this concept from all of my different
notes, and also be able to see where this concept is referenced across
all of my notes.

## Fun

Most importantly, it should be a *joy to use the tool itself*. It should
feel *good* to take notes, to list out everything I have to do and check
it off one-by-one. It's hard to want to use the system to get my life
together, unless using the system *is itself* motivating---unless I want
to *live* in the system.

Good includes being fast and flexible. The tool should be fast and
responsive. Editing notes should be quick and precise. I shouldn't need
stable WiFi to use it. Good also means lots of other little things. It
should look reasonably pretty, and it should produce reasonably pretty
notes.

The most important part of "good," though, is that if the system doesn't
do something I want it to do, *I can fix it myself.* Keyboard shortcut
isn't doing what I expect it to do? I can add it myself. Do I have a
particular system for archiving old notes I want to use? Let me program
that into the tool. There is nothing as joyful as using a tool that
doesn't demand that I change for the tool, that just does what I expect
it to do, every time.

Because many of the aforementioned tools are hosted by other people, you
*cannot* meaningfully modify or customize them. Sure, you can decorate
your Notion with aesthetic images and a nice colorscheme, and if you're
enough of a Notion wizard, you can do some fun stuff with formulas and
all that. But fundamentally, what you can do in Notion is dictated by
the Notion developers. You have no access to the underlying system, its
code, or your data.

The machinations of capital constrain both the discursive and material
dimensions of many of these tools. As mentioned above, the rhetorics of
capital insist that tools for "productivity" are only valuable if they
can make you more valuable to capitalism, as measured through hours
worked or tasks completed. Moreover, the *material* demands of capital
require that these tools' developers subvert your autonomy, locking away
their tools from customization and your data from unencumbered access.

To insist on the *joyfulness* of our tools is to reject the discursive
and material demands of capital. Joyful tools eschew these rhetorics and
demand recognition of an unquantifiable virtue these tools can bring
us---happiness! And joyful tools require us to build and imagine
*materially* different systems---systems that are introspectable and
personal.

<!-- personal as opposed to wanting to scale for everyone? -->

# Honorable mentions

So if you're trying to find your own box---a system that you can call
home---how might you go about this? What options are available to you?

I've gone through a bunch of these tools and systems myself, and boy do I have
strong thoughts and opinions about them!

## Pen and paper

The simplest, and arguably the most flexible of the available options,
is to just write things down! There's no app or subscription you need,
no fancy equipment or setup required, and it's very easy to make or
choose your own system for organizing notes and todos. Just get a
notebook or planner and write things down :^)

Pen and paper (or other handwritten media like whiteboards) offer a kind
of tactility and immediacy that is difficult to replicate in other
mediums;
<span class="aside">
Technically there are things like iPads and reMarkable tablets that let
you imitate handwriting, but the feeling of pen on paper is inimicable
imo.
</span>
it's very difficult to replicate the feeling of pen on paper and the
flexibility of being able to write wherever and however you want. Pen
and paper is also conducive to doodling---good for my constantly
distracted-ass brain---and there are studies that have shown that notes
taken through handwriting are more likely to actually create connections
in your brain and all that.
<span class="aside">
I found
<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1219945/full">this article</a>
on Google that says this; there are plenty more available I'm sure!!
</span>

The downside of pen and paper is that it lacks flexibility in other
ways. Referring to past information can be difficult---it requires you
to physically find where that information is. Modifying
information---rescheduling an event, updating a handwritten note,
etc.---can be more challenging as well.
<span class="aside">
Challenges with information retrieval and updating definitely aren't
insurmountable with traditional pen and paper, they just require extra
attention to how you record and organize info.
You can use pencils or markers to allow for small incremental fixes to
notes.
Libraries use thorough labeling taxonomies and digitized information
retrieval systems to organize resources.
And systems like the original
<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/">Zettelkasten system</a>
solve both the information retrieval and updating notes issues by
focusing on producing lots of small "atomic" notes, rather than having
big long note documents.
</span>
For instance, I used to have a paper planner in high school where I
would write in when different assignments were due and what I had
scheduled on any particular day, which was super helpful for figuring
out what work I needed to work on next. (It also felt very good crossing
off homework assignments when I finished them!) However, if I had too much work
for one day, or an assignment deadline changed, and I happened to use
pen instead of pencil, I was shit out of luck.

For me personally, I still incorporate handwritten resources into my
overall notes system in a few places. When I need to quickly brainstorm,
I gravitate towards using a pen and paper notebook that I carry around
with me wherever I go. During my most recent research push, I and my
advisor listed out our remaining tasks for the week by writing it out on
a whiteboard each week, which gave us clarity on what was finished and
what needed working on. And I used to use post-it notes to set my
intentions and focuses for a particular week.

There are also many other notable organizational systems that rely on
pen and paper. *Bullet journaling* began as a highly structured system
for folks who had tired out of using digital apps and wanted to quickly
record tasks, but has become its own subcommunity of folks interested in
both the organizational and aesthetic aspects of bullet journaling.
There are tons of examples online of incredible, beautiful bullet
journals, created by folks who find the process itself of crafting a
bullet journal joyful and therapeutic.
<span class="aside">
I briefly tried to get into bullet journaling, but immediately got
annoyed that I couldn't get the bullets to line up perfectly straight.
I'm not built for the bujo life.
</span>
The aforementioned [*Zettelkasten
system*](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) revolves around a
*slipbox* of small flashcards, each of which contains a small piece of
information---an *atomic note*. By building up a large library of these
flashcards, and maintaining a highly ordered and regular labeling system
for each flashcard, you can build a library of handwritten notes that
reference other notes, kind of like your own personal Wikipedia!

## The appetizers: Apple Notes, Google Keep, OneNote

## Todo lists: Todoist & co.

## The calendars

Many newer apps have also started to skew more towards the "everything
in one place" philosophy, combining task management and event
time-blocking in one place. Todoist does this, as does others like
Craft.
